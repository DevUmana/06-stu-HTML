    <P>Hello! My name is David Umana, I’m really looking forward to attending this boot camp since it’s been a goal for
      a while now. About me, I manage a team of technical consultants at a tech company focusing on health care tech.
      Working with developers inspired me to pursue a new career path and that is why I am here! My personality is
      easygoing, and I am always looking for opportunities to network. I can’t wait to meet everyone and work with you!
    </P>
